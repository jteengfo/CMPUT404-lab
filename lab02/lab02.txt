Question 1: How do you specify a TCP socket in Python?

s = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)

Question 2: What is the difference between a client socket and a server socket in Python?

A client socket sends requests to the server and will get back a response from the server.

A server socket listens, and accepts requests from clients and sends a response back depending on their request. 

A difference between the two is that a client only requests to get a response from the server while a server can be connected to N amount of clients, listening, and accepting requests to serve responses back to the same clients. 

Question 3: How do we instruct the OS to let us reuse the same bind port?
We use the socket.SO_REUSEADDR socket option

Question 4: What information do we get about incoming connections?
We get the connection and the address where the connection came from. The address also contains the IP address and the port the address was originally from.

Question 5: What is returned by recv() from the server after it is done sending the HTTP request?
The data that was sent by the client to the server. 

Question 6: Provide a link to your code on GitHub.
